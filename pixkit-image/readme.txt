For users
---------

* Include pixkit-image.hpp.
* Include the source code placed in /src you used.

For contributors
----------------

* Define function in pixkit-image.hpp.
* Place your source code in /src. If your code needs 
  lots of functions needed by only yourself, you can 
  use an isolate file with a name as short as possible. 
  Otherwise, we recommend you to implement your function
  into corresponding src/.cpp. For instance, if you are
  implementing a filtering function, thus implement it 
  into the src/filtering.cpp.
